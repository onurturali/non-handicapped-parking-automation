# non-handicapped-parking-automation
 non handicapped parking automation with virtualization.

 ## How it works?
 The parking lot automatically creates itself by respecting the handicapped / nonhandicapped lot ratio.
 Car entry requests are create within a certain date range, also.
 If there is still room available for handicapped or nonhandicapped, vehicles start to enter the parking lot in order.

 ## What is being done now?
 Cars exit the parking lot.

parking_area_generator.py file generates randomly parking slots. Also parking design can be drawn.
- Handicapped slot range can be defined.
- Total slots can be defined.

car_entry_request_generator.py file generates randomly car entry requests.
- Datetime is generated according to datetime range.
- Handicapped status is randomly generated as True or False.

For more information you can read comment blocks in each files.
